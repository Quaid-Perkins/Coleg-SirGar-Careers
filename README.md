# College project for Unit 13

This is the Second assignment for Unit 13 on my College Course.
Here I have to design, plan, and code a website for further education college students who are considering their next steps after their education.
I have decided to call this website "Career Compass" for the students to be guided in the correct way for them.

Requirements:

- 8 different pages.
- Accessibility features. e.g.
  - Alt text on Image.
  - Proper text Contrast.
- Target towards "further education college students".
