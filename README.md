# College project for Unit 13

This is the Second assignment for Unit 13 on my College Course.
Here I have to design, plan, and code a website for further education college students who are considering their next steps after their education.
I have decided to call this website "Career Compass" for the students to be guided in the correct way for them.

Requirements:

- 8 different pages.
- Accessibility features. e.g.
  - Alt text on Image.
  - Proper text Contrast.
- Target towards "further education college students".

## Development Tools:

[![github](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/compact-minimal/available/github_vector.svg)](https://github.com/)
[![vs-codium](https://lieonstudios.github.io/assets/v1/badge/compact-minimal/svg/vscodium.svg)](https://vscodium.com/)
[![vite](https://lieonstudios.github.io/assets/v1/badge/compact-minimal/svg/vite.svg)](https://vite.dev/)
[![solidjs](https://lieonstudios.github.io/assets/v1/badge/compact-minimal/svg/solidjs.svg)](https://solidjs.com/)
[![tailwind](https://lieonstudios.github.io/assets/v1/badge/compact-minimal/svg/tailwind.svg)](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- Using [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/) as a fast and powerful frontend compiler with:
  - [**SolidJS**](https://solidjs.com/): a Javascript library to build pages.
  - [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/): a CSS utility framework.
- Coded and ran with [**VSCodium**](https://vscodium.com/) and [**Bun**](https://bun.sh).

## How to run locally:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need `git` installed and `npm` (`pnpm`), `bun` or `yarn` installed to run this.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Quaid-Perkins/career_compass.git # install git here - https://git-scm.com/downloads

cd ./career_compass # move into the new folder

npm install # or `bun install`, or `yarn install`

npm run dev # or `bun dev` or `yarn run dev`
```

Then click on the link that gets outputted into the terminal. e.g:

```sh
VITE v6.2.1  ready in x ms
  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/career_compass/
```
